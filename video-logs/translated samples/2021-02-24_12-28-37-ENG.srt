47
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:31,440
Okay, then let's see the next such (instructor)

48
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,656
case, let's say that during the task you solved (instructor)

49
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,064
last time, when you wanted to examine the errors (instructor)

50
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:40,060
within the project (instructor)

51
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:44,240
loading the list would have taken 5 minutes (instructor)

52
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,024
meanwhile the Eclipse development environment wouldn't respond to commands (instructor)

53
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:51,408
how would this have affected you? (instructor)

54
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:53,400
Well, uuuh, 

55
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,480
I had such a, well not exactly this issue

56
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,536
but... I had library problems, for me

57
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,032
it explicitly underlined the 

58
00:03:04,032 --> 00:03:06,030
I think the stringUtilst 

59
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,352
and uuuh, when you have a specific task, then those

60
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,840
errors that do not belong there can be really annoying [laughs]

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,176
and then others also come out, obviously a project clean and 

62
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,864
etc. can solve this, usually, in Eclipse 

63
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,880
But otherwise, yeah, it annoys me a little

64
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,328
or if there are those that, 

65
00:03:25,952 --> 00:03:28,736
well, that are quite unexpected, that for 

66
00:03:28,736 --> 00:03:30,730
completely separate reasons 

67
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,928
just a kind of fiddling around, like let's say

68
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,392
the development environment is how it is, or the

69
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:38,368
the development tool, or the computer, or the 

70
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,848
whatever else, then that can annoy me

71
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:42,840
quite a lot

72
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,360
I’m not saying it would specifically negatively affect it, 

73
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,296
because this usually  

74
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,480
does occur, so it is a typical developer error 

75
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:53,808
So it's not that negative, rather it just causes  

76
00:03:53,808 --> 00:03:55,800
stressful situations, especially if you have a deadline

77
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,608
and here I imagine this as 

78
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:00,600
a deadline, because time 

79
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,808
there is a time limit

80
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,456
during which you should be finished, and my expectation is that I want to be able to finish

81
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:09,536
it might just be because of this, or if somebody 

82
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:11,530
I'm sure there are people to whom

83
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,080
to whom it doesn't matter, because they don't care

84
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,080
about it, to me this is more like a competition

85
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,320
this situation [laughs] and so

86
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,512
I want to do it well, and then

87
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,944
every other such thing bothers me.

88
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,720
so this is how it affects me, it's like 

89
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,728
it like creates a stressful situation, yeah.
