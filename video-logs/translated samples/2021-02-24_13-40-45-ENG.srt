Oookay, now let's see... what's going on here [clicks on the test case]

30
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:36,510
Well I don't know, I don't think coverage can help us much right now

31
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:45,140
I'm not trying to write a new test, well okay, clearly we can look at what it shows, oh, yeah especially if

32
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:50,340
If this is not how you do it at all, but by default did it not...?

33
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:58,570
It didn't run, well never mind then.  Well then what to do, what does it say... [deep sigh]

34
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:06,310

Good, click JUnit test, mhm

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:23,510
