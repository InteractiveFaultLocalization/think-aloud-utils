12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,080
So, our first case is (instructor)

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,080
no. 17075, and it goes like (instructor) [ambulance sirens outside] 

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,110
like 'WEE-oww', let's wait this out (instructor)

15
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,460
Alright, so 17075, the methods are (instructor)

16
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,160
in a descending order based on score (instructor)

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,160
in the iFL tool (instructor)

18
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,520
and you can find the createNumber method in 7th place in this (instructor)

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,290
list that is in a des... descending order based on score. (instructor)

20
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,410
So it's on the first page (instructor)

21
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,290
- it's the penultimate out of the 8 cards (instructor)
- The last one, yeah

22
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,030
Uuuuh, let's say that this is the method with the error (instructor)

23
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,240
so before this one you already had to examine 6 other methods (instructor)

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,480
erm, there were some here like

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,040
it's one of the bugs from Monday, I don't know how well you remember it (instructor)

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,230
it was full of these create...

27
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,530
- methods, createFloat, createBiginteger, and ... (instructor)
- Yes-yes

28
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,070
nonessestial stuff like that (instructor)

29
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,840
- bigDecimal and whatnot (instructor)
- Yes-yes

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,700
so this is the situation that there is (instructor)

31
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,640
this page full of methods in iFL, the 7th is the (instructor)

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,640
the penultimate is the (instructor)

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
the createNumber, of which we later (instructor)

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,970
learn that it is the one with the error, but you don't know that yet (instructor)

35
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,440
uuh, and by the time you get there (instructor)

36
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,440
now let's assume that you insist (instructor)

37
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,200
well maybe not insist, but you use iFL's list  (instructor)

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,610
to help you, and you already had to examine (instructor)

39
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,610
six methods, by the time you finally end up with (instructor)

40
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,610
the one that has the errors. (instructor)

41
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,990
[he thinks]

42
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,990
Erm, and so...

43
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,990
What is the question? [laughs]

44
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,360
Yeah, I know, there is no question... well erm

45
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,860
- Well basically... what is your opinion about the situation, does it affect you (instructor)
- I see 

46
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,740
- in any way...? (instructor)
- Well the problem is that...

47
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,370
I didn't exactly understand, or like... I don't know

48
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,830
if I should have understood, what, what this tool

49
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,200
erm, what it does, or rather how does it do...

50
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
well how much, uuh

51
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,090
can you, uuh

52
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,840
rely on it, so

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,840
If it's important to you, then I can tell you how (instructor)

54
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,230
those lists come to be (instructor)

55
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,540
Well, uuuuuh... yeah.

56
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,960
So this is a ... this technique is called (instructor)

57
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,960
spectrum-based fault localization (instructor)

58
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,720
where the spectrum and the coverage

59
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,240
- Mhm
- well technically the spectrum is the coverage, there's only (instructor)

60
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,240
one twist in the whole thing, (instructor)

61
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,930
namely that we are not looking at how you run the test suite and so what that covers (instructor)

62
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,650
but instead for each test you determine the (instructor)

63
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,440
what they cover, so what methods (instructor)

64
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
and from this you'll have a freaking huge matrix (instructor)

65
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,110
and we also have which methods, or I mean which tests (instructor)

66
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,680
ran with what results, whether they passed or failed (instructor)

67
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,070
Erm, and then you can get all sorts of interesting statistics from this (instructor)

68
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,860
there are thousands of millions of formulas for how you (instructor)

69
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,970
eventually calculate the score from this amount of data, but the (instructor)

70
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,970
basic assumption is that (instructor)

71
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,680
the most suspicious, so the method with the highest score (instructor)

72
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,360
erm, is the one on which only failing tests pass (instructor)

73
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,080
so you run the failing test and what (instructor)

74
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,000
- that touches on is suspicious. (instructor)
- Yes.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,420
you can add nuance to this by (instructor)

76
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,420
also running passed tests (instructor)

77
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,640
and they also touch on the ones that (instructor)

78
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,760
the failing ones did too, then there it drops a bit, so it's different... (instructor)

79
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,460
Mhm, so there are tests that

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,970
pass and

81
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,530
- is included in them, mhm. 
- And it includes what the failing did as well (instructor)

82
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,810
...soo let's say you have three methods, A, B, and C (instructor)

83
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,810
these are covered by the failing one (instructor)

84
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,280
and you have two other tests that also touch on B and C (instructor)

85
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,620
and they passed. (instructor)

86
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,940
Then the assumption is (instructor)

87
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,240
that A is more suspicious than B or C because that one (instructor)

88
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
was only included in the failing test (instructor)

89
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,540
then there really are thousands of millions of formulas (instructor)

90
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,820
to precisely take advantage or to calculate this (instructor)

91
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,400
Uuuuh, and then these (instructor)

92
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,400
result in a score, usually between 0-1 (instructor)

93
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,480
uh, and then that makes the list (instructor)

94
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,120
Mhm, and that csv, that scores

95
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,350
is that... that, how does that connect

96
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,520
- to this, is that the output of some...
- Yes it connects to this by... (instructor)

97
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,690
Yes, so this is a pretty slow and lengthy measurement process (instructor)

98
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,940
by the time these scores are produced, because it's freaking huge (instructor)

99
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,940
Ah, so it's calculated beforehand

100
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,940
- and then this is the result. 
- And then (instructor)

101
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,940
- this is the result. (instructor)
- Ah, I see.

102
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,440
Mhm.

103
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,900
Do you want me to read the situation again? (instructor)

104
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,960
Uuuuh, no you don't have to, so

105
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,300
the point is that... that our affected 

106
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,410
method is relatively

107
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,150
it's in the penultimate position in the top...

108
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,470
- 8, yeah (instructor)
- top 8, mhm. [thinks]

109
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,720
- Well whether it's the penultimate or not... (instructor)
- Yeah yeah, it's at the end, yeah

110
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,050
[thinks]

111
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,430
So for this, in this case you can

112
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,430
well obviously, if I know that

113
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,840
that that is the method that interests me,

114
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,760
but then I clearly already got there, like let's say I looked at the first one

115
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,760
or the ones before it

116
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,190
and then I could use that tool

117
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,450
to set the score, uuuuh

118
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,780
- ratios? or 
- With percentages, you can decrease or increase... (instructor)

119
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,870
Okay, then I could pretty much do that

120
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,200
I would either increase its score,

121
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,560
compared to the others', compared to the ones before or

122
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,180
- or I could lower the score of the previous ones'? 
- Exactly (instructor)

123
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,310
And by the way is that only for

124
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,330
only good for

125
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,240
let's say pulling my

126
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,410
or the affected method forward?

127
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,760
Yyyyyes, yeah-yeahs. (instructor)

128
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,230
but so this is not for some kind of training

129
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:56,380
- this is just for the given display....
- This is just static, yeah-yeah (instructor)

130
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,580
It's an interesting aspect, (instructor)

131
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,190
I'm gonna jot that down (instructor) [they laugh]

132
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,860
- that uuuuh (instructor)
- So this is just about like, like

133
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,670
get these out of here, I don't care about them, but let's say, bring 

134
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,040
- those forward that are more interesting to me. 
- Obviously you don't know from the get go what (instructor)

135
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,000
- you'll find (instructor)
- Yeah, you just make those disappear that

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Mhm, that are no longer... mhm

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
... you can weigh them, or even completely rule them out (instructor)

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and then the others come forward. (instructor)

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,660
[thinks]
