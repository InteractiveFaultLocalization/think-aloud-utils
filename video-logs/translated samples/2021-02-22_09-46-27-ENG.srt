81
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,920
well I'm gonna run the base...

82
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
or... next to the green run button

83
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,160
from the arrow pointing down we choose the TaskA configuration from the dropdown menu

84
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
[sighs]

85
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,160
[sighs]

86
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,160
from the dropdown menu choose

87
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,160
okay

88
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,160
[Clicks on the TaskA test] [runs the test]

89
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,020
now I'm waiting for it to finish running

90
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,020
I can see this is a maven project

91
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,020
though I could guess that from the

92
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,020
src/main/java structure and

93
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,020
from POM

94
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,980
It's interesting though, because the JRE system library says Java 1.6

95
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,530
but here it was run with 1.7

96
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,530
[clears his throat]

97
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,120
well anyway

98
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,120
I'll look into this

99
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,040
okay here I can see

100
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,690
it deleted them

101
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,260
[adjusts glasses]

102
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,930
I'll search for

103
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,430
in math

104
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,430
the... erm

105
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,760
NumberUtils.java

106
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,670
but otherwise you should search for it in the test

107
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,670
but for this

108
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,770
Java class (unintelligible)... you can make sense of the test

109
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,160
I will open these

110
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,040
and I'll search for the testCreatNumber test

111
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,520
this is a constructor

112
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,920
testToInt

113
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,540
string

114
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,540
this is a relatively long file so I will

115
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,540
search with ctrl+f

116
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,030
umm... I hope this will work

117
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,260
I'm looking for the test [types]

118
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:54,820
Creat, but anyway in eclipse there should be an option to see

119
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
the functions

120
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,810
in Window maybe editor

121
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,040
show view and here is one called

122
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,040
not project

123
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,040
buut

124
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,780
expressions maybe

125
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,780
nope nope nope nope

126
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,100
I want to see somewhere the...

127
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
what this contains

128
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,250
never mind, I'll just search for it instead of wasting more time on it, because I don't know how they

129
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,250
planned this one and a half hour
