49
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:53,184
Okay, well erm, now we'll try to use this iFL - oh I still haven't selected the project

50
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,840
Okay, here are the failed tests

51
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
iFL [clicks]

52
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:07,104
Erm, yes, so now I selected the project in iFL, erm, okay

53
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,832
[waits]

54
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,872
We're gonna test what this tool is good for, now that I know how 

55
00:03:15,872 --> 00:03:17,870
how it works. 

56
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:24,528
Well this puts it in a different context now that I know how it works

57
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,800
[makes faces while waiting]

58
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
But sadly the...

59
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:38,352
... the tool is not too, tool fast [laughs at pun]

60
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,350
Whoops [looks at the results]

61
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:45,104
[looks at the results] Now it's showing us something

62
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,504
[looks at the results]

63
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,520
Maybe if it's in the project root it will load automatically? 

64
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,000
Because, erm... [clicks]

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,488
[clicks] Because yesterday, well never mind, I'll click on Load scores again

66
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,944
Uuuuuh, [clicks]

67
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,040
[clicks]

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,776
Okay, well it says that [clicks] based on the score

69
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:17,770
I'll put it in order

70
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,096
from top to bottom

71
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:26,176
there's only one problem with this, which is that the signature is ... mhm

72
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,416
Well it's... scrollable

73
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:31,648
The error will be at Fraction

74
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,704
the Fraction's test ... yeah

75
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,224
let's look at this... erm

76
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,464
I double click it, right? Then it will jump to it?

77
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,176
Does it also open it? Or just...if it's open will it jump to it? No, it also opens it, awesome

78
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,832
Uuuh, okay, so theoretically this

79
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:56,688
[looks at the plugin] in this test there are errors

80
00:04:56,688 --> 00:04:58,680
[looks at the plugin]

81
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,704
[mumbles] fraction, fraction, fraction....

82
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,984
let's see

83
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,152
Name: reduce

84
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,872
It's a bit lower, okay, it's quite big

85
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,408
[clicks] Well...

86
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,400
[clicks]

87
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,072
Well this is... [mumbles] maybe there won't be errors in (unintelligible)

88
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:28,240
But these are, pretty big [keeps clicking]

89
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,240
...pretty big methods

90
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:34,320
getNumerator, there won't be errors in this one

91
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,048
I will go on and lower its score

92
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:45,824
How did it go? Maybe you just need to... [clicks]

93
00:05:45,824 --> 00:05:47,820
[clicks]

94
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,152
[clicks, looks at the plugin]

95
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,448
[looks at the method, clicks] that's it 

96
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,288
Erm [reads the function]

97
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,608
Context feedback... good

98
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,960
So I will lower this, I won't modify the others yet, but I'll lower this, 'cause

99
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,352
this definitely won't have errors.

100
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:16,350
getter

101
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:22,112
[keeps clicking]

102
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:26,224
[mumbles] Mutable ... oh yes, here with 

103
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,280
the ordering - I would report a bug with iFL that if you modify the context, then the

104
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,008
ordering will disappear, Denominator

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,496
[clicks] erm

106
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,984
I could do multimple ones at the same time 

107
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:49,760
erm Fraction, here well, I suppose there won't be any errors here either

108
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,448
erm... getReduceFraction

109
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:02,048
... here the rows are a little skewed, Position, but whatever, I found these, this is fine
